Hello!
To run this for testing you need to 1) Get PostgresSQL on your pc and import the .sql file from the dbFolder
                                    2) type in terminal 'npm install' (to install all dependencies)
                                    3) 'cd server' to go to server folder and node server to open the server
                                    4) create whoever many terminals you want and to start the client type 'npm start'. this will start the app.
