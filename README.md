Hello!
  
  to use the app you need to install Docker Desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
  After cloning the repository, start setup.bat. 
  when the process is finished, go to dist\TalkBack-win32-x64\TalkBack.exe to start the client.
  (to simulate multiple users open the client multiple times)
  When you want to end the process, click the close-server.bat
